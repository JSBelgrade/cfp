Call for Papers for JS Belgrade Meetups.

We are developers and Github is something that most of us are using everyday, so we decided to put CFP here.

JS Belgrade Meetups are organized each month, we don't have exact date it depends on a various things, only "rule" is that they are on Saturday afternoon.

So if you want to talk on one of the next JS Belgrade Meetups, here's how to apply:

## How to apply

Instead of sending an email just [create a new issue](https://github.com/JSBelgrade/cfp/issues/new) in this repository.

**Info to include:**

A few things about you:

- Your name (first and last, please);
- Your email or any other way to contact you;
- Tell us something about yourself;
- [optional] Twitter and other handles;

And a few things about the topic:

- Title or topic;
- Short description/abstract;
- Preferred language - Serbian or English;
- Approximate duration of the talk;
- Do you prefer small (<30 people) or big (>100 people) meetup?
- When do you want to talk on our meetup? Please check [a list of next meetups]() first.

## Topics

We are opened for any topic directly or indirectly related to JavaScript and Node.js.  
Please try to avoid talks about your products etc. unless your product is some awesome JS library (Browserify, Babel...) or something that would be really interesting for our audience.

Check a list of previous themes for the idea.

## FAQ (fake, no one asked those things yet)

1. Can I present our meetup/conference/free course on your meetup?
   
   Yes. If it's something cool (and if you want to give some free tickets :)) you are more than welcome to present your meetup/conference/anything else. Send us an [email](mailto:jsbelgradeorg@gmail.com) or [create an issue](https://github.com/JSBelgrade/cfp/issues/new) and we'll discuss details.
